- Spearheaded a firm’s transition to a paperless practice by implementing a faster and safer web-based inventory management and accounting system, improving employee productivity by 40% and reducing accounting errors by 75%.
- Reduced front-end development time by 30% and improved code maintainability by creating modular, reusable [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components using [React.js](https://react.dev/) and TypeScript.
- Achieved sub-second (< 1 sec) page load times by optimizing the website’s performance (deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)) with the help of lazy loading and code-splitting techniques.
- Bettered average [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) query time from 2.5 to 1.1 seconds through pagination, indexes, projections, and other query optimization and server caching techniques (using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)).
- Decreased the total testing time in half and produced more reliable results by automating front-end tests (through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)) and back-end tests (through [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)).
- Eliminated most production issues and reduced deployment time by 65% by streamlining the build, test, and deploy pipelines (using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)).
- Adopted best practices from Agile and CI/CD, resulting in faster feedback loops and tripling the frequency of releases.
