- Developed a highly distributed, scalable (proof-of-concept) cryptocurrency <ins>min</ins>er in <ins>Er</ins>lang and enhanced its flexibility with the help of 5 different hashing algorithms.
- Attained a hash rate of 10K Hs/s (on each node) by employing a custom, distributed mining approach that uses concurrent, lightweight, and highly parallelized worker processes.
- Used supervision trees to make the system more fault-tolerant and eliminated 80% of all runtime errors with the help of Erlangâ€™s robust error-handling mechanisms.
